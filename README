1 - Install

source path_to/geant4-v11.2.1-build/geant4make.sh
make

2 - Run

> dwarf runall.mac

Will run all source positions.

> dwarf run_muon.mac

Will simulate light emitted uniformly along the length of the detector, such as from a CR muon

> dwarf
 >> /control/execute test.mac
 >> /control/execute vis.mac

To test the geometry setup. It creates three views from different angles to 
check the position of the source holder and the PMT

3 - Analyse

> root ana.C

Makes the plots.
